# Data mining for rainfall classification

In this work, data mining techniques were explored in several meteorological variables to perform the classification of rainfall. To this end, a flow was followed to apply pre-processing methods to the data and to build and evaluate the classification models. The best result of the experiment indicates a 96% accuracy rate to classify the rains as **"no rain", "light rain", "moderate rain" and "heavy rain"**.
